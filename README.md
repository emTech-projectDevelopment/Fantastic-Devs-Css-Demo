# Fantastic-Devs-Css-Demo

Hi Team!

I have started a basic set of CSS animations we can learn and develop on your own. 

More importantly is that i have used the CSS Grid which adds super easy responsiveness
and the format used is the simplest way to create a really complex layout.

I hope you enjoy and build on what we have here :)

Happy Coding! :)
